- simple UNIX command interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...);
.sp
#include "holberton.h
.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is an emulation of UNIX command interpreter.
.sp
.B Overview
.sp
As an emulation, the simple_shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets
them, and generally executes other commands.
.sp
.B Invocation
.sp
If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal
the shell is considered an interactive shell.
.sp
An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles
programming and command errors differently.
.sp
This was done as an exercise for Holberton School
.sp
.B Return:
.sp
The number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
.sp
.B Output:
.sp
The _printf write output to stdout, the standard output stream.
.sp
.B Format:
.sp
The function can receive as argument a string of characters. This can be
done by writing them in double quotes "". For example: Using the function in the following
way _printf("Holberton"); will give the following output: Holberton
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The _printf besides receiving a string of charaters it can also receive what we call
.I conversion specifiers.
In this case, insted of receive a string of chars, the argument will receive the % char followed
by a conversion specifier that is a single character (It has to be inside double quotes "%specifier"). Depending on the type it will print the corresponding output.
.sp
.PP
After the % followed by the specifier, a comma (,) will separate it from the next argument that must be avariable that has the same type of the char specifier.
.sp
.B Example
.sp
To invoke the function passing specifiers to it:
.sp
_printf("%specifier", variable of type specifier);

.sp
.B Types of Conversion Specifiers
.sp
%c Prints a
.I single character.
.sp
%s Prints an
.I entire string
.sp
%d, %i Prints an
.I integer.
.sp
%b Prints an integer in
.I binary format.
.sp
%u Prints an
.I unsigned integer.
.sp
%o Prints an
.I octal integer.
.sp
%x, %X Prints an
